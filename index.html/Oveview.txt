Project Title: OverThink Blog Website

Project Overview
OverThink is a minimal, two-page blog website designed to reflect calmness, creativity, and slow living.
The purpose of the project was to build a small but elegant website using only HTML and CSS.
The site includes a homepage with featured articles and a post page with a full-length article layout.

Technologies Used:
HTML5 – for clean, semantic structure
CSS3 – for layout, colors, and responsiveness
Google Fonts – for the Inter font family
Font Awesome – for social media icons

Files in the Project:
home.html – main landing page with hero image and featured posts
post.html – detailed blog post page
style.css – single shared stylesheet for both pages
images/ – folder containing hero and content images

Objectives
The main goals of the OverThink blog project were:

To build a multipage static website with consistent design and structure.

To use semantic HTML tags for accessibility and SEO.

To create a clean and responsive layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid.

To maintain a calm, modern, and balanced visual style.

To organize all styling in one CSS file for simplicity and reusability.

Website Structure

Home Page (home.html)

A fixed header with navigation links and social media icons.

A hero section featuring the website name, tagline, and a background image.

Two featured article cards displayed horizontally.

A responsive grid section displaying more recent articles.

A footer with quick links, resources, and copyright details.

Post Page (post.html)

Same fixed header and footer for design consistency.

A detailed article with headings, inline images, and highlighted takeaways.

A clean layout for comfortable reading.

Folder Structure:
Blog Website/
│
├── home.html
├── post.html
├── style.css
└── images/
  └── hero.png

Design Choices
The design emphasizes calmness and clarity.
Colors: Light gray for the header, deep navy for the footer, and soft neutral tones for text and backgrounds.
Typography: The Inter font provides clean and modern readability.
Layout: Flexbox is used for alignment and responsiveness, while CSS Grid handles the article card layouts.
Spacing: Generous margins and padding ensure comfortable reading.
Finishing touches: Rounded corners, soft shadows, and subtle hover effects for smooth interaction.

Example of Header HTML:

<header>
  <nav>
    <ul class="navMenu">
      <li><a href="home.html" class="navButton navActive">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="post.html" class="navButton">Posts</a></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="socialLinks">
      <li><a href="#"><i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i></a></li>
      <li><a href="#"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i></a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>


Example of CSS for Navigation Buttons:

.navButton {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 0.6rem 1.6rem;
  border-radius: 999px;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.navButton:hover {
  background: #1f2937;
  color: #f8fafc;
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}


Key Features

Fixed Navigation Bar – Always visible while scrolling for easier access.

Responsive Card Layout – Uses CSS Grid with auto-fit and minmax properties.

Hero Section – Built with Flexbox; text on one side, hero image on the other.

Multi-Column Footer – Organized with Grid for clean link sections.

Reusable Components – The same header and footer across both pages.

CSS Organization
The stylesheet is organized into logical sections for easy editing:

Global Styles – Base resets, body, and font rules.

Header & Navigation – Sticky header and link styles.

Hero Section – Layout and image styling.

Cards – Grid system, padding, and image ratio control.

Footer – Gradient background and multi-column layout.

Post Page – Article typography, image styles, and highlights list.

Example of Responsive Grid CSS:

.articleGrid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(320px, 1fr));
  gap: 2.4rem;
  margin: 4rem auto;
}

.articleCard img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 220px;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 8px;
}


Challenges and Solutions
Challenge 1: Fixed header overlapping the hero section
Solution: Added top padding to the body to offset the header height.

Challenge 2: Inconsistent image sizes in cards
Solution: Used object-fit: cover to keep all images uniform without distortion.

Challenge 3: Footer alignment
Solution: Implemented CSS Grid in the footer with defined column spacing for balance.

Challenge 4: Page consistency
Solution: Reused the same HTML structure and CSS classes across pages.
